Declan's New Album

This also gives me a chance to let everyone know that I have a new record coming out October 28th. It's called '_**Declan O'Rourke -- In Full Colour**_' have you heard of it!? :)This record consists of 16 songs, recorded with a [50 piece orchestra (The RTÃ‰ Concert Orchestra)][0].
12 of the 16 songs are material drawn from across my 4 previous 
records, re-imagined and re-recorded for this scenario, along with 4 new
songs.

I know most of you will want to make an event of it and camp outside the shops overnight that week, but [here's the link to where you can pre-order it][1] if you want to get your free instant download of 'Children Of 16' from the same record! (available on iTunes only).
